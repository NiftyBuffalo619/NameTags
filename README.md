# Nifty's Tags
This is a Java Spigot Plugin used for my server to change player's tag using 
[TagAPI](https://github.com/keehl254/TagAPI).
## Config
The plugin will create a folder inside the plugins folder called NameTags
the config file will be inside it.To add a Tag to a player type this to the 
config.yml.
```
PlayersUUID:
  tag: "[YOURTAGHERE]"
SecondPlayersUUID:
  tag: "CustomTag"
```

## Dependencies
Please note this plugin requires both the [TagAPI](https://github.com/keehl254/TagAPI)
and [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to run.
