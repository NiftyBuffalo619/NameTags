# Nifty's Tags
This is a Java Spigot Plugin used for my server to change player's tag using 
[TagAPI](https://github.com/keehl254/TagAPI).
# Dependencies
Please note this plugin requires both the [TagAPI](https://github.com/keehl254/TagAPI)
and [ProtocolLib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/) to run.
